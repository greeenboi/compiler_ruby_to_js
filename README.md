# Ruby Compiler

Contains a tokenizer, a parser, and a code generator.

By the end, it successfully compiles some code in our language `test.src`
, producing JavaScript output that we can execute. 

While most compilers are highly optimized for speed, but ours will be optimized for easy readability and understanding.
